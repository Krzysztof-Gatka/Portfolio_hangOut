It's time to create second portoflio project, in this project I would like to ground my Angular knowledge, and improve design and styling skills.

The app has single purpouse, to make hanging out with your friends easier. User can create friend groups, where it is possible to create meetings, with specified date, duration and activity, but it is nothing new, the main feature of this app will be possibility to add your availabilty for such meetings in each friend group to make choosing meeting date more straight forward without having to reach out to every firend independently.

brainstorming:

While developing my first project MealSelect I have changed styles and markups so many times that I still have nightmares about it, to avoid that this time
I am starting development of this app by using Figma to create design of the app, I hope that it will save me a lot of time and headaches.
App design will appear here soon !
